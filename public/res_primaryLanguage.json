During my time there, I developed the ability to adapt swiftly and gain knowledge of various emerging technologies. Although the work environment was pleasant and engaging, I yearned for a greater sense of purpose and impact. Therefore, when the chance arose to join Facebook in 2018, I eagerly seized it. However, I soon realized that the impact I was making there did not align with my desired contribution to the world. Consequently, I made a complete shift away from the technology industry.",
